    "The Forge of Fury\n",
    "\n",
    "In the grimy shithole of Ironspike, where the air stank of sweat and molten steel, there was a forge that burned like a bastard’s hell. It was Korr’s domain, a hulking son of a bitch with fists that could smash skulls and a temper that’d fuck up anyone dumb enough to look at him wrong. He hammered out swords that’d gut you clean and axes that’d chop your damn head off, and he didn’t take shit from nobody—not the greedy-ass merchants, not the piss-drunk fools who staggered near his flames.\n",
    "\n",
    "One scorching day, a cocky prick named Gav rolled into town—scarred-up, skinny as a rat, and grinning like he owned the fucking place. He stormed into Korr’s forge and slammed a dented breastplate down, barking, “Fix this, you slow-ass bastard, I’ve got a fight to win!” Korr’s eyes turned to slits, his hammer freezing mid-swing. “You don’t fucking tell me what to do, you little shit,” he snarled, stepping up so his bulk could crush Gav’s balls just by standing there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The air was thick with hate. Gav didn’t back down—he spat a glob of phlegm on the floor and sneered, “I’ve fucked up bigger assholes than you.” That lit the fuse. Korr roared like a goddamn bull, chucking his hammer at Gav’s smug face. It missed by a cunt hair, smashing a rack of spears to splinters. Gav charged, pulling a nasty-ass dagger, and the forge turned into a fucking warzone. Sparks flew as they went at it—Korr swinging red-hot tongs like a madman, Gav slashing like a rabid dog. The townsfolk hauled ass out of there, their screams lost in the fire’s roar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blood hit the floor. Korr smashed Gav into the anvil, cracking his ribs like twigs, but Gav jammed his blade into Korr’s shoulder, blood hissing like piss on the coals. They tore into each other, no mercy—Korr’s fists pounding, Gav’s knife slicing. A table got fucked, the bellows exploded, and the flames shot up, ready to burn the whole damn place down. “I’ll rip your fucking head off!” Korr bellowed, grabbing Gav’s throat. Gav laughed like a psycho, smashing his forehead into Korr’s nose—crunch, blood everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "It ended when Korr, half-blind with rage, hoisted Gav up and threw him into the forge. Gav’s scream was cut short as the fire ate him alive, his dagger clattering uselessly. Korr stood there, chest heaving, blood dripping, the forge a smoking ruin. “Fucking done,” he spat, kicking the breastplate into the ashes. Ironspike wouldn’t forget that day—Korr’s fury was the law now, and no bastard would dare test it again.\n",
